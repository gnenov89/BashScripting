# BashScripting






## Bash + Python with a sprinkle of jq

## Project Goal:

This project is part of a Python(Flask) application designed to provide AWS-cli clients with a better user experience. AWS-cli services can be quite confusing for newcomers so we've decided to add an extra layer of navigation and much more user-friendly interface.

## Project content:

* dump.sh - This script reads a .json file (help.json in this instance) and splits it's values to .json files in directories. With a little help of ```jq```

* 
* Navigating between routes
* Nesting routes
* URL parameters
* 404 error routes
* Changing routes programmatically

* [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
